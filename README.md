# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
# Overview
This project delved into the realm of credit card fraud detection. The primary objective was to create a robust model that could accurately discern fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. This summary encapsulates the key steps and methodologies employed in achieving this goal.

# Methodology
## Data Preprocessing: 
To set the stage, the dataset underwent meticulous preprocessing. This included crucial steps like data sampling, which enhanced the quality of our training data, and segregating transactions into legitimate and fraudulent categories.

## Train-Test Split: 
Rigorous evaluation is the cornerstone of any model's success. With this in mind, I performed a train-test split on the data. This allowed us to train our model on a substantial portion of the dataset while reserving a separate segment for unbiased testing.

## Algorithm Choice: 
For the heart of the project, I opted for the tried-and-true Logistic Regression algorithm. Known for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks, Logistic Regression was a fitting choice to identify potential credit card fraud.
